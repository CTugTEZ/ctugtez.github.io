						<h1>Homogeneous transit timing analyses of 10 exoplanet systems</h1>
						<h2>2022/03, MNRAS, DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac592">Link to paper</a></h2>
						<p>
							We study the transit timings of 10 exoplanets in order to investigate potential transit timing 
							variations in them. We model their available ground-based light curves, some presented here and 
							others taken from the literature, and homogeneously measure the mid-transit times. We statistically
							compare our results with published values and find that the measurement errors agree. However, 
							in terms of recovering the possible frequencies, homogeneous sets can be found to be more useful, 
							of which no statistically relevant example has been found for the planets in our study. We corrected 
							the ephemeris information of all 10 planets we studied and provide these most precise light elements
							as references for future transit observations with space-borne and ground-based instruments. We found 
							no evidence for secular or periodic changes in the orbital periods of the planets in our sample, 
							including the ultra-short period WASP-103 b, whose orbit is expected to decay on an observable time-scale.
							Therefore, we derive the lower limits for the reduced tidal quality factors (Q′⋆⁠) for the host stars 
							based on best-fitting quadratic functions to their timing data. We also present a global model of all
							available data for WASP-74 b, which has a Gaia parallax-based distance value ∼25 per cent larger than
							the published value.

							decreased from 5.1 AU to 0.35 AU), allowing monitoring of the long-term
							evolution of coma morphology during comet ISON's pre-perihelion leg. Data were
							contributed by observers spread around the world, resulting in particularly
							good temporal coverage during November when comet ISON was brightest but its
							visibility was limited from any one location due to the small solar elongation.
							We analyze the northwestern sunward continuum coma feature observed in comet

							We present a new observational campaign, Dwarf,
							aimed at detection of circumbinary extrasolar planets using the timing of the
							minima of low-mass eclipsing binaries. The observations will be performed
							within an extensive network of relatively small to medium-size telescopes with
							apertures of ˜20-200 cm. The starting sample of the objects to be monitored
							contains (i) low-mass eclipsing binaries with M and K components, (ii)
							short-period binaries with a sdB or sdO component, and (iii)
							post-common-envelope systems containing a WD, which enable to determine minima
							with high precision. Since the amplitude of the timing signal increases with
							the orbital period of an invisible third component, the timescale of the
							project is long, at least 5-10 years. The paper gives simple formulas to
							estimate the suitability of individual eclipsing binaries for the circumbinary
							planet detection. Intrinsic variability of the binaries (photospheric spots,
							flares, pulsation etc.) limiting the accuracy of the minima timing is also
							discussed. The manuscript also describes the best observing strategy and
							methods to detect cyclic timing variability in the minima times indicating the
							presence of circumbinary planets. First test observations of the selected
